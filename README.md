# 🏞️ Which Park Should You Visit?  
## National Parks Edition...

As a National Parks enthusiast, I created this app to help fellow explorers decide *which parks to visit next!* This tool is designed to guide your future adventures.

Fun fact: I’ve been lucky enough to visit 15+ National Parks so far, but my all-time favorite is Yellowstone in Wyoming. 🦬



### What this app offers:

- Personalized park recommendations  
- Highlights and must-see spots  
- Inspiration for your next outdoor adventure
